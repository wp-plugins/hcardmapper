This Plugin allows your users to easily fill out your comment forms using an hCard.

== Description ==

hCardMapper is a Plugin based on [hCard-Commenting](http://notizblog.org/projects/wp-hcard-commenting/)
and the [hCardMapper-Script](http://lib.omnia-computing.de/hcardmapper)
It allows your visitors to easily fill out your comment forms using an hCard. I got this
Idea from SignUp pages like [bragster.com](https://www.bragster.com/signup) or 
[getsatisfaction.com](http://getsatisfaction.com/people/new).

hCardMapper now supports [representative hCards](http://microformats.org/wiki/representative-hcard)

== Installation ==

* Upload the `hcardmapping` to your **plugin** folder

Thats it

It should work for the most themes (like K2 or Kubrik) without changes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which Microformats parser do you use? =

I use the [hKit](http://allinthehead.com/hkit/) parser from Drew McLellan and the hKit
service from [microformatic.com](http://tools.microformatic.com/help/xhtml/hkit/).

= Why do you also use the service =

hKit needs PHP5, if you run PHP4.3 you can't run the hKit parser natively.

= What are the next steps? =

hCard.photo as avatar, like hAvatar.
